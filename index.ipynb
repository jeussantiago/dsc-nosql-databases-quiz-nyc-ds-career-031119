    "# NoSQL Databases - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll try our luck with some common open-ended interview questions about NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a NoSQL and a SQL database?  Which is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Database is a Relational Database and a structured one whereas NoSQL is Non-relational database likely to be more document and distributed than structured.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "You might ask what exactly mean Relational Database?\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Relational database strictly adheres relations where it is divided into the set of rows and columns to store data often named as tables, but the Non-relational database has a document-oriented or distributed storage which doesnâ€™t require any table structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe a situation where a NoSQL database might be a better choice than a relational database, and explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "NoSQL uses hierarchical data storage, and there is no hierarchical data storage for SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "How does MongoDB work? How is it different from a relational database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL/MongoDB uses hierarchical data storage, and there is no hierarchical data storage for SQL. It uses a key-value Storing system, comparable to dictionaries in Python. It differs from SQL in that each document has it's own schema\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "What is fault tolerance, and what does it have to do with Resilient Distributed Datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Fault Tolerance is the property that allows machines to continue running in the event of any failures. This relates to RDDs because RDDs are fault tolerant in that they save their informations on multiple servers in case a few servers go down and you're not trapped waiting for the server to come back up.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "What is MapReduce? How is it related to Hadoop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Map\" is MapReduce is the process of running the same process on multiple machines\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we reviewed some common NoSQL interview questions. "
